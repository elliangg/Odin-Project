        The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's incredibly customizable,<br>
        so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true to <br>
        the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:</p>
        
        <p>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.<br>
        Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to<br> add tons of flavor.
        Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans<br> of tomato paste.
        Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.<br>
        Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil<br> leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
        Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.<br>
        Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.<br>
        Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.<br>
